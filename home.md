Hi, I'm Zack. I'm an incoming PhD student in the [Software Practices Lab](https://spl.cs.ubc.ca/) Lab at the University of
British Columbia, working under the supervision of Alex Summers.

My main research interest is program verification: proving that a program
operates correctly with respect to a formal specification of its intended
behaviour. Currently, I am focused on development of the Rust program verifier
Prusti. Previously, I worked on Liquid Haskell, a program verifer for Haskell
that uses refinement types.
