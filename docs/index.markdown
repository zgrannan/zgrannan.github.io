Hi, I'm Zack. I'm an incoming PhD student in the <a
href="https://spl.cs.ubc.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software
Practices Lab</a> at the <a href="https://www.ubc.ca" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">University of British Columbia</a>, working under the
supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~alexsumm/" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex Summers</a>.

My main research interest is program verification: proving that a program
operates correctly with respect to a formal specification of its intended
behaviour. Currently, I am focused on development of the Rust program verifier
<a href="https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/prusti.html" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Prusti</a>. Previously, I did some work on <a
href="https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell/" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Liquid Haskell</a>, a program verifier for Haskell
that uses refinement types.

A list of my papers is available <a href="/papers.html" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. See <a href="/personal.html" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for personal info.

I can be reached via email at the following address: zgrannan at cs dot ubc dot
ca. You can also contact me at my personal email: zgrannan at protonmail dot
