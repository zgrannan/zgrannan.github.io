# Personal Info

I live in Vancouver, BC with my wife and two kids. Before starting graduate
school, I worked in the e-commerce space. In 2017, <a
href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrykronick/">Hank Kronick</a> and I
co-founded OrderMetrics, a company that helped merchants analyse their financial
data. OrderMetrics was acquired by <a
href="https://withassembly.com/">Assembly</a> in November 2019. Before that I
was a software developer at <a href="https://www.socialprintstudio.com/">Social
Print Studio</a>.

My main hobby is spending too much time on side projects (nothing at the moment,
however). Besides that I also enjoy studying Chinese; my wife and I travel to
Taiwan frequently so I have some incentive to practice. I also enjoy reading and
running (not at the same time).
